## Nav
-One of my biggest wins was getting the hamburger icon to work.
-I was able to style it relatively quick by using bootstrap and then a simple fix in the @media section were I just set the display to display: block;
-Also, the JS of this section clicked fast
-Managed to make the text hover 
-Sometimes my nav bar disapears (Home, about, work contact) - not sure why. I have to refresh the page to see it.
-I have to click the hamburger icon twice for it to swipe down and show me my options - not sure why?

### Main Image and Text
-One of y biggest wins was that I got my main image to work and got them to work as rows. 
-However, it could still be better and I will try to improve it by making it a background so that I can explore more with text styling. 
-Setting my margin to -20px made the styling between my title and my sub title work 

#### About

-Went smoothly. I but a box-color property so I could make the background and the specific area black.

##### Works

-Used flexbox. 
-Was having difficulties styling the page when my width was to the min but was able to fix the sizing.  

###### Slideshow
-Could still use more work. 
-My text and circles are outside the slideshow. 
-Swipe arrows are also out of place.
-Took me a while to figure it out with JS.
